### Browse and Discovery

- Dashboard sections for Keep Reading, On Deck, Recently Added, Recently Updated, and pinned collections/read lists, with quick offline actions for current or full book sections where supported.

- Spotlight indexing for downloaded content, plus iOS widgets and Home Screen quick actions for Keep Reading, Search, and Downloads.

### Offline and Sync
